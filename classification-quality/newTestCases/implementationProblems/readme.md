Which test cases belong to this category?
1. test cases that Parcaoch does not cover but we do
2. test cases that reveal problems in either Parcoachs or our implementation that are solvable in theory (e.g. proper inlining or function nesting or funcation call handling (see resursive test case))
3. test cases that cover specific programming model semantics such as that only the second mpi_fence is synchronizing
